<h1> Justin I DON'T miss you 😂</h1>
<h2>sorry but is is the tuth</h2>
<p> Dear Justin,
    today as you obviously know you weren't in school,we all were wondering why but since nither Alex wasn't in school 
    we think you two boys were together palyng videogames;is that true? if so please contact the school and tell them
    to tell us. If not then you have to know that you missed some very important news like for example that the maths 
    summative is due soon.
    Anyways please don't come back it was beautiful without you and Alex.
    You always make the teacher stop in class because you talk with others but mostly Giovanni and you don't understand anything
    you even need to stop coming to school because nearly no one likes you!!!! so just come to sayb beye and take your things.
    kind regards 
    sofia
